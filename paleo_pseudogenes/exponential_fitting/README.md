# Fitting single- and double-exponential function to WGM-derived (gene and pseudogene) numbers

These scripts were used to generate figures and fit the exponential functions to the time vs number data.

To explore the evolution through time of WGM-derived pseudogenes and the number of gene-gene anchor pairs, the quantities were graphed against the timing of the most recent WGM, utilizing both million years ago (MYA) and Ks-value of the most recent WGM in each species (obtained from Vanneste et al., 2014). Subsequently, we attempted to fit a single- and double-exponential function to this dataset using the lmfit library (Newville et al., 2016) in Python. The single-exponential function corresponds to the simple passive or random loss model whereby (pseudo)genes are lost randomly. The double-exponential function approximates the two-phase model described by Inoue et al. (2015). This model comprises an initial rapid phase, characterized by the simultaneous loss of multiple genes, followed by a second phase with a lower rate of loss. Regression fits were evaluated and compared through R-squared, Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) statistics.
